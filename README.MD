For the lazy people that can't remember all the shortcuts.
The default shortcut is ctrl+3.
It can be modified through the Options -> Shortcuts menu.
To access/search any menu just press ctrl+3.
Somebody might know that feature from eclipse already.
Might get some improvements later ...

Binary releases can be found under release-tab (auto-deployed by appveyor on any commit).
