used for github codespaces.

also needed to execute the following terminal commands:
sudo apt update && sudo apt-get install qtbase5-dev && sudo apt install g++-mingw-w64

theoretically compile with (still buggy - won't compile but still helpful to find errors):
qmake DO_MSYS=1 && make

fully compiling probably won't work (yet?).
so I'm still stuck to appveyor ...
atleast I don't need to commit to appveyor that othen anymore ...
